# ### Calculate
# 
# Use the cells below to make the following calculations:
# 
# 1. 20 plus 30 (the code is given, just run the cell)
# 2. 20 minus 30
# 3. 20 times 30
# 4. 20 divided by 30
# 5. 20 to the power 30 (*hint*: use two asterisks: `**`)

# Exercise 1

# ### Variables
# 
# 
# 1. Create a variable `a` and assign the value `20`, so `a = 20`
# 2. Create a variable `b` and assign the value `30`
# 3. Add `a` and `b`, the outcome should be 50
# 4. Multiply `a` by `b`, the outcome should be 600

# ### Datatypes
# 
# 1. Without using the computer, write down on a piece of paper what you think the `type` is for every letter (`a` to `i`) 
# 2. Assign the values by running the cell below
# 3. Use the `type()` function to check your answers. For example, to check the first one use `type(a)`

# Exercise 2 - Run this cell
a = 42 
b = "hello world"
c = 3.14
d = 100
e = "23"
f = 10 * 10
g = 10 / 10
h = [1, 2, 3]
i = {"name": "John", "age": 42, "role": "developer"}

# ### Printing
# 
# ```python
# # Example
# city = "Amsterdam"
# country = "The Netherlands"
# print(city, country)
# print(city, country, sep=',')
# ```
# 
# The exercise:
# 
# 1. Assign your first name to a variable called `first_name`
# 2. Assign your last name to a variable called `last_name`
# 3. Print your first and last name to the screen with the `print` function
# 3. Again print your first and last name to the screen, but this time separated by a dot (`.`) instead of a space (` `)

# ### Getting user input
# 
# ```python
# # Example
# day = input("Which day is it? ")
# print("Today is", day)
# ```
# 
# Exercises: 
# 1. Create a variable called `name`. Use the `input()` function to get the user's name
# 2. Use the variable `name` to print a greeting to the screen, like `Hello, nice to meet you John`
# 
# *Extra challenge*: print the sentence in the following format: `Hello John, how are you?`

# Extra challenge


# ### Type casting
# 
# ```python
# # Examples
# days_per_week = 7
# str(days_per_week)
# 
# score = "6700"
# int(score)
# ```
# 
# The exercise:
# 1. Use the `str()` function to fix the bug in the code below
# 2. Use the `int()` function to fix the bug in the code below

# Exercise 1
number_of_moons = 79
sentence = "The total number of (known) moons for the planet Jupiter is " + number_of_moons
print(sentence)

age_in_years = input("What is your age? ")
age_in_months = age_in_years * 12
print("Your age in months is: ", age_in_months)
